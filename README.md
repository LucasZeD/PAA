# Projeto e Análise de Algoritmos (PAA)

In here there are files regarding the course PAA of Computer Science Bachelors of PUC Minas.
The are activities are both given by Silvio Jamil F Guimarães, PAA's professor, both self given.

## Implementation 1

We were tasked to implement the algorithms Breadth-first Search (BFS) and Depth-fist Search (DFS) in C++.

### DG_AdjacencyList.cpp

Implemented an directed Graph using adjacency list and the task is to categorize each of the graphs edges using a DF Search.

### NDG_AdjacencyMatrix.cpp

The task was to implement a Non-Directed Graph using adjacency matrix and find the graph's eccentricity using a BF Search.
